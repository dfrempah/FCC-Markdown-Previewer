# FCC: Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Markdown Previewer

A live Markdown previewer. Fun fact: This README was built and previewed with this project.

## Built with React and Redux 

## Test Cases passed : 12/12

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVVO.


You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
